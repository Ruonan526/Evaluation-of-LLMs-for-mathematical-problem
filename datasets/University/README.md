## University-level Problems Dataset

This directory describes the university-level mathematics problems used in the qualitative evaluation.

Due to copyright and academic integrity considerations, the full problem statements are not publicly released.  
The problems were collected from upper-level undergraduate and postgraduate mathematics courses (e.g., statistical inference, optimisation, and applied mathematics).

Key characteristics of this dataset:
- Problems are **not standard benchmark questions**
- Emphasis is placed on multi-step reasoning, theoretical justification, and solution structure
- Evaluation focuses on reasoning completeness, logical coherence, and use of appropriate mathematical tools, rather than final answers alone

Representative problem structures and evaluation criteria are described in the paper.
The dataset is available upon reasonable request for research and review purposes.
